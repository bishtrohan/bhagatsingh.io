    <h1>Intro</h1>
    <p class="para">
        Bhagat Singh (23 March 1931) was an Indian socialist revolutionary whose two acts of dramatic violence against
        the British in India and execution at age 23 made him a folk hero of the Indian independence movement.In
        December 1928, Bhagat Singh and an associate, Shivaram Rajguru, fatally shot a 21-year-old British police
        officer, John Saunders, in Lahore, British India, mistaking Saunders, who was still on probation, for the
        British police superintendent, James Scott, whom they had intended to assassinate.They believed Scott was
        responsible for the death of a popular Indian nationalist leader Lala Lajpat Rai as a result of having ordered a
        lathi charge in which Rai was injured, and, two weeks thereafter, died of a heart attack. As he exited a police
        station on a motorcycle, Saunders was felled by a single bullet fired from across the street by Rajguru, a
        marksman.Lying injured on the ground, he was then shot up close several times by Singh, the postmortem report
        showing eight bullet wounds.Another associate of Singh, Chandra Shekhar Azad, shot dead an Indian police
        constable, Chanan Singh, who attempted to pursue Singh and Rajguru as they fled.After having escaped, Singh and
        his associates publicly announced avenging Lajpat Rai's death, putting up prepared posters that they had altered
        to show Saunders as their intended target, their own names appearing under pseudonyms.Singh was thereafter on
        the run for many months, and no convictions resulted at the time. Surfacing again in April 1929, he and another
        associate, Batukeshwar Dutt, set off two improvised explosive devices inside the Central Legislative Assembly in
        Delhi. They showered leaflets from the gallery on the legislators below, shouted slogans, and then allowed the
        authorities to arrest them.The arrest, and the resulting publicity, brought to light Singh's complicity in the
        John Saunders case. Awaiting trial, Singh gained much public sympathy after he joined fellow defendant Jatin Das
        in a hunger strike, demanding better prison conditions for Indian prisoners, the strike ending in Das's death
        from starvation in September 1929. Singh was convicted and hanged in March 1931, aged 23.

    <h1>Early life</h1>
    <p class="para">
        Bhagat Singh was a Sandhu Jat,born in 1907 to Kishan Singh and Vidyavati at Chak No. 105 GB, Banga village,
        Jaranwala Tehsil in the Lyallpur district of the Punjab Province of British India present day Pakistan.
        His birth coincided with the release of his father and two uncles, Ajit Singh and Swaran Singh, from jail.
        His family members were Hindus and Sikhs; some had been active in Indian Independence movements, others had
        served in Maharaja Ranjit Singh's army. His ancestral village was Khatkar Kalan, near the town of Banga, India
        in Nawanshahr district (now renamed Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar) of the Punjab.

        His family was politically active.His grandfather, Arjun Singh followed Swami Dayananda Saraswati's Hindu
        reformist movement, Arya Samaj, which had a considerable influence on Bhagat.His father and uncles were
        members of the Ghadar Party, led by Kartar Singh Sarabha and Har Dayal. Ajit Singh was forced into exile due to
        pending court cases against him while Swaran Singh died at home in Lahore in 1910 following his release from
        jail.
        Unlike many Sikhs of his age, Singh did not attend the Khalsa High School in Lahore. His grandfather did not
        approve of the school officials' loyalty to the British government.He was enrolled instead in the Dayanand
        Anglo-Vedic High School, an Arya Samaji institution.The Arya Samaj philosophy greatly influenced him
        throughout his life.
        In 1919, when he was 12 years old, Singh visited the site of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre hours after thousands
        of unarmed people gathered at a public meeting had been killed.When he was 14 years old, he was among those
        in his village who welcomed protesters against the killing of a large number of unarmed people at Gurudwara
        Nankana Sahib on 20 February 1921.Singh became disillusioned with Mahatma Gandhi's philosophy of
        non-violence after he called off the non-co-operation movement. Gandhi's decision followed the violent murders
        of policemen by villagers who were reacting to the police killing three villagers in the 1922 Chauri Chaura
        incident. Singh joined the Young Revolutionary Movement and began to advocate for the violent overthrow of the
        British Government in India.
        In 1923,Bhagat Singh (circled) in a group photo of the Dramatic Club of National College,Lahore
        In 1923, Singh joined the National College in Lahore,where he also participated in extra-curricular
        activities like the dramatics society. In 1923, he won an essay competition set by the Punjab Hindi Sahitya
        Sammelan, writing on the problems in the Punjab.Inspired by the Young Italy movement of Giuseppe
        Mazzini,he founded the Indian socialist youth organisation Naujawan Bharat Sabha in March 1926.He also
        joined the Hindustan Republican Association,which had prominent leaders, such as Chandrashekhar Azad, Ram
        Prasad Bismil and Shahid Ashfaqallah Khan.A year later, to avoid an arranged marriage, Singh ran away to
        Cawnpore.In a letter he left behind, he said:
        My life has been dedicated to the noblest cause, that of the freedom of the country. Therefore, there is no rest
        or worldly desire that can lure me now.
        Police became concerned with Singh's influence on youths and arrested him in May 1927 on the pretext that he had
        been involved in a bombing that had taken place in Lahore in October 1926. He was released on a surety of Rs.
        60,000 five weeks after his arrest.He wrote for, and edited, Urdu and Punjabi newspapers, published in
        Amritsar and also contributed to low-priced pamphlets published by the Naujawan Bharat Sabha that excoriated
        the British.

        He also wrote for Kirti, the journal of the Kirti Kisan Party ("Workers and Peasants Party") and briefly for the
        Veer Arjun newspaper, published in Delhi.He often used pseudonyms, including names such as Balwant,
        Ranjit and Vidhrohi.

    <h1>Freedom struggle</h1>
    <p class="para">
        Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev were sentenced to death in the Lahore conspiracy case and ordered to be hanged on 24
        March 1931.The schedule was moved forward by 11 hours and the three were hanged on 23 March 1931 at 7:30 pm in
        the Lahore jail. It is reported that no magistrate at the time was willing to supervise Singh's hanging as was
        required by law. The execution was supervised instead by an honorary judge, who also signed the three death
        warrants, as their original warrants had expired.The jail authorities then broke a hole in the rear wall of the
        jail, removed the bodies, and secretly cremated the three men under cover of darkness outside Ganda Singh Wala
        village, and then threw the ashes into the Sutlej river, about 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) from Ferozepore.
